- 2 cups (480mL) heavy cream
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, cubed

9. For the sauce, in the same skillet:
   - Add cream, remaining butter, and minced garlic
   - Bring to a simmer
   - Season with salt and pepper
   - Gradually whisk in parmesan cheese until smooth
10. Remove sauce from heat

12. Toss to coat, adding reserved cooking water as needed to thin sauce

14. Divide pasta among bowls

16. Garnish with parsley and serve

## Notes
- For extra flavor, season chicken with 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning before cooking
- Always save some pasta water - it helps thin and emulsify the sauce
- Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for best melting
- Can add red pepper flakes to sauce for heat
- Use a microplane or small holes of box grater for parmesan
- Pasta water can help fix a broken cream sauce
