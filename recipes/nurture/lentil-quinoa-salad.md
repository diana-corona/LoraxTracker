## Ingredients
- 1 cup dry quinoa (yields ~3 cups cooked), rinsed

- 1/2 cup red onion, diced
- 1 cucumber, seeded & diced
- 1/2 cup canned lentils, drained & rinsed (or cooked)
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped

- (Optional) Fresh mint (if available), chopped
- Pinch flaky salt (finishing)

### Lemon Herb Dressing
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- Kosher/sea salt to taste
- 1–2 tsp balsamic glaze (to drizzle when serving; or 1 tsp balsamic vinegar mixed in)

## Instructions
1. Cook Quinoa: In a pot combine rinsed quinoa with 2 cups water (or broth + pinch salt). Bring to boil, reduce to low, cover, cook 15 minutes or until liquid absorbed. Remove from heat; rest covered 5 minutes. Fluff and spread to cool.
2. Prep Vegetables & Nuts: Quarter tomatoes, dice red onion and cucumber, chop parsley (and mint if using), crush nuts.
3. Dressing: In a small bowl whisk lemon juice, oregano, pepper, and salt until seasoning dissolves. (Hold balsamic glaze for finishing drizzle.)
4. Combine: In a large bowl add cooled quinoa, lentils, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, parsley, mint (optional), and nuts. Pour dressing over; toss gently to coat.
5. Finish: Adjust salt, pepper, lemon. Drizzle balsamic glaze over top (or gently fold in). Sprinkle flaky salt if desired. Serve chilled or room temperature.

## Notes
- Grain Swap: Use farro, bulgur, couscous, or millet instead of quinoa.
- Nut-Free: Substitute roasted sunflower or pumpkin seeds.
- Meal Prep: Keeps 4 days refrigerated; add nuts just before serving for maximum crunch.
- Add-Ins: Diced bell pepper, olives, crumbled vegan feta, or chopped spinach.
- Dressing Variation: Add 1–2 tbsp olive oil for richer mouthfeel (optional).
- Texture Tip: Cool quinoa fully before mixing to prevent herbs from wilting.
