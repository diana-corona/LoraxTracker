## Ingredients
- 3 cups cooked rotini pasta (cooled; ~1 1/2 cups dry)
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup canned chickpeas, drained & rinsed
- 1 cup artichoke hearts (jarred), drained & chopped
- 1 cup arugula, chopped (or baby spinach)
- 1 small red onion, finely diced
- Salt & pepper to taste

### Creamy Pesto Dressing
- 1/4 cup vegan pesto
- 1/2 cup unsweetened vegan yogurt
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Pinch salt & pepper (adjust to taste)

## Instructions
1. Cook Pasta: Boil rotini in salted water per package until al dente. Drain; spread to cool (avoid overcooking or it will turn mushy when dressed).
2. Dressing: In a small bowl/jar whisk pesto, vegan yogurt, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until smooth. Adjust seasoning (more lemon for brightness, pesto for intensity, yogurt for creaminess).
3. Combine (Bowl Method): In a large bowl add cooled pasta, chickpeas, red onion, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, and arugula. Pour dressing over and fold gently until coated. Season with additional salt & pepper.
   - Jar Meal-Prep Variant: Layer (bottom to top) dressing (2–3 tbsp), chickpeas, red onion, artichokes, tomatoes, pasta, arugula. Seal; shake before eating.
4. Chill 15–30 minutes (optional) for flavors to meld or serve immediately.

## Notes
- Swap arugula with baby spinach or chopped/massaged kale.
- Additions: olives, roasted red peppers, toasted pine nuts, sunflower seeds.
- Protein Boost: extra chickpeas, white beans, or grilled tofu.
- No vegan yogurt: sub blended silken tofu or cashew cream (loosen with water).
- Gluten-free: use GF pasta (chickpea/lentil for higher protein).
- Storage: Airtight up to 4 days (jar method keeps greens crisp). Refresh with a squeeze of lemon if flavors mute.
