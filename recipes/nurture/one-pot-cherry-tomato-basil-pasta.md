## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups cherry tomatoes (about 560g)
- 1 tbsp harissa paste or Calabrian chili paste
- ½ lbs spaghetti (gluten-free if needed)
- 3½ cups boiling water
- ⅓ cup nutritional yeast
- 1 large handful fresh basil

## Instructions
1. In a saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil, cherry tomatoes and garlic
2. Saute until fragrant and the cherry tomatoes begin to soften (approximately 3 minutes)
3. Add the harissa/Calabrian chili paste and stir until the tomatoes and garlic are coated
4. Add the spaghetti to the pan
5. Pour the boiling water over the pasta
6. Cook and stir frequently until the pasta is tender and the water has almost evaporated, creating a light sauce
7. Turn off the heat
8. Stir in nutritional yeast and basil
9. Serve immediately, with vegan parmesan if desired

## Notes
- Everything cooks in one pot - no need to drain pasta
- Not a fan of spice? Use sun-dried tomato pesto instead of chili paste
- Can swap spaghetti for penne, fusilli, or linguine - any pasta shape works
- Gluten-free noodles work well too
- For added protein, stir in chickpeas or use chickpea pasta
- Can get creative with herbs - try adding kale or rosemary to the sauce
