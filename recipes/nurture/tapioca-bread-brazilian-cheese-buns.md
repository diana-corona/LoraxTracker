- 260 g milk
- 110 g butter
- 6 g salt
- 100 g grated Parmesan (or mature cheddar)
- 2 eggs

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C.
2. Prepare a non-stick 12-cup muffin tray.
3. In a medium pot combine milk, butter, and salt; bring to a rolling boil.
4. (While hot) Combine the hot liquid with tapioca flour until a sticky dough forms.
5. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until evenly combined (mixing by hand helps).
6. Mix in the grated cheese until incorporated.
7. Fill each muffin cup about 3/4 full and smooth tops (lightly oil hands if needed).
8. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
9. Cool slightly and serve warm.

## Notes
- Tapioca (cassava) flour is gluten free and gives the buns their chew.
- Dough is sticky; oiling hands helps portioning.
