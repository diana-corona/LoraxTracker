   - Baking powder
   - Salt
2. In another bowl, whisk together wet ingredients:
   - Eggs and egg yolk

3. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until batter forms
4. Slowly stream in melted butter while whisking until combined

7. Add enough batter to fill iron about ¾ full
8. Cook until golden brown (flip if needed according to your waffle iron)
9. Serve immediately with desired toppings

## Notes
- Don't overmix the batter - some small lumps are okay
- Butter should be melted but not too hot when adding to batter
- Keep waffles warm in a low oven (200°F) while making remaining batches
- For extra crispy waffles, let them cook slightly longer
- Can be frozen and reheated in toaster
- Fresh batter works best - don't let it sit too long
- Makes about 4-6 large waffles depending on your iron
