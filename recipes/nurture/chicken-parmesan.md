10. Transfer to a baking sheet
11. Top each chicken breast with:
    - ¼ to ⅓ cup marinara sauce
    - Generous amount of mozzarella
    - About 1 tablespoon Parmesan
12. Bake for 15-20 minutes until:
    - Chicken is cooked through
    - Cheese is melted and golden
13. Garnish with fresh basil and parsley leaves

## Notes
- Pound chicken cutlets evenly to ensure uniform cooking
- Chicken breasts are preferred over thighs for this recipe
- Provolone can be substituted for mozzarella
- Serving suggestions:
  - Over spaghetti with additional marinara sauce
  - With buttered noodles (2 tbsp melted butter + juice of half lemon)
- For crispier coating:
  - Ensure oil is hot before frying
  - Don't overcrowd the pan
  - Let breaded chicken rest for 5 minutes before frying
- Can be made ahead through frying step:
  - Store breaded, fried chicken in refrigerator
  - Top and bake when ready to serve
