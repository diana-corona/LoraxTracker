## Ingredients
- 16 oz whole wheat farfalle (or penne; use GF if needed), cooked & cooled
- 1 small red onion, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, chopped
- 1/2 cup black olives, chopped (optional)
- 1 cup marinated artichoke hearts, chopped & drained
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 1/2 cup vegan feta (optional)
- (Optional) Chili flakes to taste
- Salt & pepper to taste

### Italian Dressing
- 1/4 cup olive oil (sub vegetable broth for lighter/oil-free)
- 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1/4 tsp sea salt (plus more to taste)
- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions
1. Cook Pasta: Boil in well-salted water until al dente. Drain; spread on tray to cool (avoid rinsing unless using GF pasta that clumps).
2. Prep Veg: Dice onion, chop tomatoes, olives, artichokes, basil, and crumble vegan feta.
3. Dressing: In a jar whisk/shake olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper until emulsified. Adjust acidity (vinegar/lemon) or seasoning to taste.
4. Combine: In a large bowl add cooled pasta, onion, tomatoes, olives, artichokes, basil, and vegan feta. Pour dressing over; toss gently to coat.
5. Season: Add salt, pepper, and chili flakes if using. Chill 15–30 minutes for flavors to meld or portion immediately for meal prep.

## Notes
- Oil-Free: Replace oil fully with vegetable broth; shake before serving (dressing separates faster).
- Add-Ins: Roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, chickpeas, diced cucumber, spinach, or toasted pine nuts.
- Protein Boost: Add 1–2 cups cooked chickpeas or white beans.
- Storage: Keeps 4–5 days refrigerated; refresh with a squeeze of lemon before serving.
- Gluten-Free: Use a sturdy GF pasta (brown rice, chickpea, or lentil) and rinse briefly to remove excess starch, then dry on a towel before mixing.
- Flavor Tip: Reserve 1–2 tbsp dressing to stir in just before eating for brightness.
