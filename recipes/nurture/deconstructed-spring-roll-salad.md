## Ingredients
### Salad
- 1 cup prepared rice noodles (dry ~2 oz), cooked per package, cooled
- 1 cup red cabbage, thinly shredded
- 1 carrot, shaved into ribbons
- 1/2 cup cilantro or parsley, chopped
- 100 g firm tofu, cubed (air-fried or baked until crisp)
- (Optional toppings) Crushed peanuts, sriracha, sprouts or microgreens

### Peanut Hoisin Dressing
- 2 tbsp peanut butter (sub other nut/seed butter if needed)
- 1 tbsp hoisin sauce (use GF if required)
- 1/4 cup plant milk (plus extra to thin)
- (Optional) 1–2 tsp lime juice for brightness
- (Optional) 1 tsp maple syrup if sweeter profile desired
- Pinch salt to taste (only if needed; hoisin is salty)

## Instructions
1. Crisp Tofu: Air fry tofu at 375–400°F (190–200°C) ~15 minutes (shake halfway) until golden; or bake on lined tray 400°F ~18–22 minutes.
2. Cook Noodles: Prepare rice noodles per package. Drain; rinse briefly in cool water; drain thoroughly and set aside.
3. Prepare Vegetables: Shred cabbage, shave carrot into ribbons, chop herbs.
4. Dressing: Whisk peanut butter, hoisin, and plant milk until smooth. Adjust thickness with more milk. Add optional lime juice or maple syrup; season to taste.
5. Assemble: In a large bowl combine noodles, cabbage, carrot, herbs, and tofu. Pour over dressing; toss gently to coat.
6. Finish & Serve: Top with crushed peanuts, sriracha, sprouts or microgreens. Serve immediately or chill briefly.

## Notes
- Nut-Free: Use sunflower seed butter or tahini; top with toasted seeds.
- Noodle Alternatives: Udon, glass (mung bean), or soba noodles work.
- Protein Boost: Double tofu or add edamame.
- Meal Prep: Store components separately up to 4 days; toss before serving. Keep dressing in a jar (thin if it thickens).
- Texture Tip: Pat tofu dry before cooking for better crispness.
- Flavor Variations: Add shredded lettuce, sliced bell pepper, cucumber matchsticks, or a dash of rice vinegar in dressing.
