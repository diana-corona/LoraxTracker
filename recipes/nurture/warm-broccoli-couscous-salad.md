## Ingredients
### Roasted Broccoli & Chickpeas
- 2 heads broccoli, florets separated (stems peeled & diced or reserved)
- 1 can (15 oz / ~425 g) chickpeas, drained & rinsed
- 2 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Couscous
- 1 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous (whole wheat or regular; quinoa or rice substitute)
- 1 1/4 cups vegetable broth (plus a splash more if needed)

### Add-ins
- 1/4 cup pistachios (or walnuts), chopped
- 1 handful fresh dill, chopped
- 1 handful fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/2 cup vegan feta, crumbled (optional)

### Tahini Lemon Dressing
- 3 tbsp tahini
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1 heaping tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp warm water (plus more to thin)
- 3 tbsp olive oil (optional, for richer mouthfeel)
- Salt & pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. Roast: Pat broccoli florets and chickpeas dry. Toss with olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, dried parsley, salt, and pepper. Spread evenly; roast 18–22 minutes until edges are browned and chickpeas slightly crisp.
3. Cook Couscous: In a saucepan bring vegetable broth to a simmer. Add couscous, cover, reduce heat; cook 8–10 minutes until tender and liquid absorbed. Fluff; keep warm (add a spoon of broth if drying).
4. Dressing: In a jar/bowl whisk tahini, lemon juice, Dijon, nutritional yeast, warm water, and (if using) olive oil until smooth. Thin in small increments with additional warm water to a pourable consistency. Season with salt & pepper.
5. Assemble: In a large bowl combine warm couscous, roasted broccoli & chickpeas, pistachios, dill, parsley, and vegan feta (if using).
6. Dress: Pour over dressing (start with ~2/3) and gently fold. Add remaining dressing as desired for coating.
7. Season & Serve: Adjust salt, pepper, or lemon. Serve warm or room temperature.

## Notes

- Nuts: Swap pistachios for pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds for nut-free.
- Broccoli Stems: Dice and roast with florets or save for soup.
- Meal Prep: Store components separately up to 3 days; combine & dress before serving.
- Reheat: Briefly warm in skillet over low heat with a splash of broth to loosen.
