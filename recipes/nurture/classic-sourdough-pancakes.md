## Tags

## Ingredients

### Overnight Sponge
- 227g (1 cup) unfed/discard sourdough starter
- 454g (2 cups) buttermilk
- 240g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 28g (2 tablespoons) granulated sugar

### Pancake Batter
- All of the overnight sponge
- 2 large eggs
- 50g (1/4 cup) vegetable oil or 57g (4 tablespoons) melted butter
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt

## Instructions

### Overnight Sponge
1. In a large bowl, stir together the unfed starter, buttermilk, flour, and sugar
2. Cover and let rest at cool room temperature (65°F to 70°F) for about 12 hours or overnight. The mixture will expand and become bubbly

### Making the Pancakes
1. In a small bowl or mixing cup, beat together the eggs and oil (or butter)
2. Add the egg mixture to the overnight sponge, stirring just to combine
3. Add the baking soda and salt, stirring to combine. The batter will expand and may bubble
4. Pour the batter by 1/4-cupful onto a preheated, lightly greased griddle
5. Cook until bubbles form and pop on the top side of the pancakes
6. Turn over and cook until browned underneath
7. Serve immediately with your favorite toppings, or keep warm in a low-temperature oven until ready to serve

## Notes
- Uses sourdough discard, making it a great way to use up excess starter
- Can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days
- Can be frozen for longer storage
- The overnight rest gives these pancakes their signature sourdough flavor
- Batter will be bubbly and light due to the fermentation process
