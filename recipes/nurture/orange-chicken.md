## Instructions
For the sauce:

For the chicken:
1. Fill Dutch oven or large skillet with about 1 inch of oil
2. Heat oil to 350Â°F over medium-high heat
3. Whisk eggs in bowl
4. Add chicken pieces to egg and coat well
5. In large bowl, whisk flour and cornstarch together
6. Dredge egg-coated chicken in flour mixture
7. Set coated pieces aside on plate

To cook:
1. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown
2. Meanwhile, warm sauce in pan
3. Add cornstarch slurry to sauce and simmer until thickened
4. Add fried chicken to warmed sauce
5. Toss to coat evenly
6. Sprinkle with green onions
7. Serve over rice

## Notes
- Can make sauce spicier by adding fresh chili or more red chili flakes
- Fresh orange juice recommended but can use store-bought (100% juice, not concentrate)
- Don't skip orange zest - provides essential flavor
- Monitor oil temperature while frying for crispy coating
- Warm sauce while chicken fries to save time
- Leftovers keep 3-4 days in fridge or can be frozen
- For gluten-free version, use tamari instead of soy sauce
- Better than takeout version of the classic Chinese-American dish
