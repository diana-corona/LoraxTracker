## Notes
- Can make sauce spicier by adding fresh chili or more red chili flakes
- Fresh orange juice recommended but can use store-bought (100% juice, not concentrate)
- Don't skip orange zest - provides essential flavor
- Monitor oil temperature while frying for crispy coating
- Warm sauce while chicken fries to save time
- Leftovers keep 3-4 days in fridge or can be frozen
- For gluten-free version, use tamari instead of soy sauce
- Better than takeout version of the classic Chinese-American dish
