## Ingredients
- 1½ pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/16 inch thick
- 1½ tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary (or 1½ teaspoons dried rosemary)
- 2-3 garlic cloves, pressed
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for greasing

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)
2. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with olive oil
3. Peel sweet potatoes and slice them very thinly (1/16 inch) using a mandoline or sharp knife
4. In a large bowl, combine olive oil, pressed garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper
5. Add sweet potato slices to the bowl and toss gently to coat evenly
6. Stack the sweet potato slices in the muffin cups, creating little towers
7. Cover the muffin tin with foil
8. Bake covered for 30 minutes
9. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until edges are crispy and centers are tender
10. Let cool in the tin for 5 minutes
11. Carefully remove stacks using a spoon or small spatula

## Notes
- A mandoline slicer is recommended for uniform, thin slices
- If using a knife, try to keep slices as uniform as possible for even cooking
- Can be made ahead and reheated in a hot oven for 5-10 minutes
- Variations:
  - Add grated Parmesan between layers
  - Use different herbs like thyme or sage
  - Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat
- The thinner the slices, the crispier the edges will be
- Make sure to grease the muffin tin well to prevent sticking
