## Notes
- Can use a deep-sided skillet if you don't have a wok
- Don't overcook the eggs in step 2 as they'll cook more when added back to the dish
- Keep skillet nice and hot, especially before adding rice to get it crispy
- Best made with day-old chilled rice, but can use packaged pre-cooked rice
- Variations:
  - Can substitute chicken with turkey or ham
  - For low-carb version, use cauliflower rice
- Recommended to use free range and organic chicken and eggs for best results
