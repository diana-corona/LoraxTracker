- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot (40g)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions
1. Hard boil the eggs: Bring water to a gentle simmer in a medium pot
2. Cook eggs until done, then cool in cold water
3. Chop the eggs and place them in a medium bowl
4. Add the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, shallot, parsley, dill, salt, and pepper
5. Stir well until evenly combined
6. Serve the egg salad in a sandwich, or on lettuce as a salad

## Notes
- Can use different fresh herbs like basil, chives, thyme, or tarragon
- Optional add-ins for texture:
  - Capers
  - Finely chopped dill pickles
  - Sweet pickle relish
  - Celery
  - Radishes
  - Apples
  - Cucumber
- Can swap shallot for scallions, minced red onion, or pickled red onions
- For a lighter version, replace half the mayo with Greek yogurt or sour cream
- Can add hot sauce (Tabasco, sriracha, or sambal oelek) for heat
- Don't overcook the eggs - whites will become rubbery and yolks will turn dry and grey
