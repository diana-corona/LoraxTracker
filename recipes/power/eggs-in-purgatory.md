## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced (202g)
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 (14.5-ounce/411g) cans diced tomatoes
- 2 fresh basil sprigs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 large eggs
- Grated parmesan for serving
- Crusty bread for serving

## Instructions
1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat
2. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes
3. Add the canned tomatoes, basil sprigs, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper
4. Stir, then bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until slightly thickened, 2 to 4 minutes
5. Create wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into them
6. Cover and cook until eggs are done to your liking
7. Serve hot with grated parmesan and crusty bread

## Notes
- Use stainless steel or enameled cast iron skillet (avoid regular cast iron or reactive metal pans as tomatoes' acidity can damage them or cause metallic taste)
- Can swap basil for other herbs like thyme, tarragon, oregano, or rosemary
- Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for better melting
- This is an Italian version of shakshuka, where eggs are poached in a flavorful tomato sauce
