- 3 cups diced ripe tomatoes (495g)
- 1 cup chopped white onion (130g)
- ¾ cup chopped green chiles (168g)
- 2¼ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1¼ teaspoons salt

Additional Ingredients:
- 1 (15-ounce/425g) can black beans or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 6 tablespoons vegetable oil (90ml)
- 8 corn tortillas
- 8 large eggs

For Serving:
- Chopped fresh cilantro
- Crumbled queso fresco
- Pico de gallo
- Sliced avocado
- Fresh lime wedges

## Instructions
1. Make the salsa: Combine tomatoes, onion, green chiles, cumin, and salt
2. Transfer the salsa to a blender. Remove the center lid insert and cover with a clean kitchen towel to allow steam to escape
3. Puree until smooth, about 20 seconds. Set aside
4. Heat beans in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally
5. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat
6. Fry tortillas one at a time until lightly crisp, about 30 seconds per side. Set aside and keep warm
7. In the same skillet, add remaining oil and fry eggs to desired doneness
8. To assemble: Place 2 tortillas on each plate
9. Top each tortilla with warm beans and a fried egg
10. Pour warm salsa over the eggs
11. Garnish with cilantro, queso fresco, pico de gallo, and avocado slices
12. Serve with lime wedges

## Notes
- For a spicier salsa, add jalapeños or increase the amount of green chiles
- Tortillas should be lightly crisp but still pliable
- Eggs can be prepared sunny-side up, over-easy, or to your preference
- Can be served with additional hot sauce if desired
- Best served immediately while eggs and tortillas are hot
