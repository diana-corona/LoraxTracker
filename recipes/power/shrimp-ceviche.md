## Ingredients
- 3/4 cup fresh lime juice (180mL)
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (60mL)
- 1/4 cup fresh orange juice (60mL)
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined (454g)
- 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced (182g)
- 1/3 cup finely chopped red onion (42g)
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro (12g)
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and diced (22g)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 avocado, diced (175g)
- Tortilla chips, for serving

## Instructions
1. In a glass or non-reactive bowl, combine lime juice, lemon juice, and orange juice. Reserve 1/2 cup of the juice mixture and set aside
2. Cut peeled and deveined shrimp into bite-sized pieces if large
3. Add shrimp to the remaining citrus mixture and let marinate until the shrimp turns opaque and appears "cooked" (about 15-20 minutes)
4. While shrimp is marinating, combine diced tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeño in a separate bowl
5. Once shrimp is ready, drain excess citrus juice
6. Combine marinated shrimp with the vegetable mixture
7. Add salt and toss to combine
8. Gently fold in diced avocado just before serving
9. Serve chilled with tortilla chips

## Notes
- Use a glass or non-reactive bowl (stainless steel, ceramic, or plastic). Avoid aluminum or copper bowls as they can react with citrus
- For extra spice, use a serrano pepper or leave the jalapeño seeds intact
- Optional additions:
  - Diced fruit like mango or pineapple for sweetness
  - Crisp vegetables like cucumber, red bell pepper, or green onion
- To reduce the sharp taste of red onion, soak it in cold water before using
- Can substitute or combine shrimp with firm white fish, scallops, sea bass, or octopus
- Citrus juice will "cook" the shrimp through a chemical process called denaturation
