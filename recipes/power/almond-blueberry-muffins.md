4. In a separate bowl, beat eggs until light and fluffy
5. Whisk honey and almond extract into the beaten eggs
6. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined
7. Gently fold in the frozen blueberries (keeping them frozen helps prevent color bleeding)

## Notes
- Using frozen blueberries helps prevent them from breaking down during mixing
- These muffins are gluten-free thanks to the almond flour
- Store in an airtight container:
  - Room temperature: 2-3 days
  - Refrigerated: up to 1 week
  - Frozen: up to 3 months
- The xanthan gum helps bind the ingredients since there's no gluten
- Can substitute other berries for the blueberries if desired
