4. In a large bowl, toss Brussels sprouts with avocado oil, salt, and pepper
5. Spread Brussels sprouts on a large baking sheet in a single layer, cut side down
6. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the Brussels sprouts are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside
7. Remove from oven and transfer to a serving bowl
8. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar

## Notes
- For extra crispy Brussels sprouts, make sure they're completely dry before tossing with oil
- You can start with ¼ cup balsamic vinegar and add more to taste
- The Brussels sprouts should be golden brown and slightly charred for best flavor
- Can be made ahead and reheated in the oven
- Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days
- For a vegetarian version, omit the bacon and add toasted nuts for crunch
