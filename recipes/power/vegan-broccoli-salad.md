## Ingredients
### Salad
- 5 slices tempeh bacon (store-bought or homemade), cooked & chopped
- 2 heads broccoli, finely diced (florets; stems peeled & minced or reserved)
- 1/4 cup pistachios, chopped (or sunflower/pumpkin seeds for nut-free)
- 1 yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 small red onion (or 1/2 large), diced

### Creamy Tahini Sriracha Dressing
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 3 tbsp warm water (plus more to thin)
- Juice of 1 lemon (about 2–3 tbsp)
- 2 tbsp sriracha (adjust for heat)
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- Pinch salt & freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions
1. Cook Tempeh Bacon: Prepare per package or recipe until crisp; cool slightly and chop.
2. Prep Broccoli: Finely dice florets (and tender stem bits if using) for small, spoonable pieces.
3. Chop Remaining Veg: Dice yellow bell pepper and red onion; chop pistachios.
4. Dressing: In a jar whisk tahini, warm water, lemon juice, sriracha, maple syrup, salt, and pepper until smooth. Add water 1 tsp at a time to reach a pourable, creamy consistency. Adjust heat (sriracha), brightness (lemon), or sweetness (maple) to taste.
5. Assemble: In a large bowl combine broccoli, bell pepper, red onion, tempeh bacon, and pistachios. Pour over most of the dressing; toss to coat. Add remaining dressing if needed.
6. Serve immediately or chill 15–30 minutes to meld flavors.

## Notes
- Texture: Finely chopping broccoli improves dressing distribution; lightly steam (1 minute, then chill) if a softer texture is preferred.
- Nut-Free: Replace pistachios with roasted seeds.
- Protein Boost: Add edamame or chickpeas.
- Milder Dressing: Reduce sriracha to 1 tbsp and add extra 1 tsp maple.
- Make Ahead: Keep dressing separate up to 4 days; mix before serving for best crunch.
- Leftovers: Dressed salad keeps 2–3 days (broccoli softens slightly).
- Broccoli Stems: Peel, mince, and include, or save for stir-fries/soup.
