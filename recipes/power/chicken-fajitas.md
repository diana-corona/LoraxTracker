- 1½ teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 to 3 pieces)
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 limes
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 bell peppers, seeded and sliced into strips
- Warm tortillas
- Sour cream
- Lime wedges
- Optional: guacamole, shredded cheese, pico de gallo

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, mix together all fajita seasoning ingredients
2. Slice chicken breasts into thin strips
3. In a large bowl, combine:
   - Sliced chicken
   - Juice of 1 lime
   - Half of the fajita seasoning
4. Let chicken marinate for 15-20 minutes if time permits
5. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat
6. Cook chicken in a single layer until golden brown and cooked through (165°F), about 6-8 minutes
7. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside
8. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet
9. Add sliced onion and cook, stirring frequently until starting to soften (about 5 minutes)
10. Add bell peppers and cook until crisp-tender (about 5 minutes)
11. Return chicken to the skillet
12. Add remaining fajita seasoning and juice of second lime
13. Stir to combine and heat through
14. Serve hot with warm tortillas and desired toppings

## Notes
- Best cooked in a cast-iron skillet for optimal sear, but stainless steel or non-stick works too
- Cook in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan
- Use a meat thermometer to ensure chicken reaches 165°F
- Slice bell peppers evenly for consistent cooking
- Can be served in lettuce wraps instead of tortillas for a low-carb option
- Make ahead tip: 
  - Slice vegetables and chicken in advance
  - Mix seasoning and store in an airtight container
- Great for meal prep:
  - Store components separately
  - Reheat gently to avoid overcooking
- Customize heat level by adjusting amount of chili powder
