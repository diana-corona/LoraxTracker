## Ingredients
For the Chicken:
- 2 (8-ounce/225g) boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1½ teaspoons olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

For the Filling:
- 2 ounces cream cheese, softened (56g)
- ¾ cup fresh spinach, finely chopped (24g)
- 3 tablespoons grated parmesan
- 2 tablespoons diced tomato
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions
1. Optional: Freeze chicken breasts for 10-15 minutes to make them easier to cut
2. In a small bowl, stir together all filling ingredients until well combined
3. Place each chicken breast on a cutting board and cut a pocket into the fattest long side (do not cut all the way through)
4. Stuff each pocket with the filling and secure the opening with toothpicks
5. Rub the outside of the chicken with oil
6. Sprinkle salt, garlic powder, paprika, and pepper all over the chicken
7. Preheat the air fryer to 375°F
8. Place the stuffed chicken breasts in the air fryer basket
9. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F
10. Let rest for 5 minutes before removing toothpicks and serving

## Notes
- Cheese variations: Can use mozzarella, smoked gouda, Swiss, or cheddar instead of parmesan
- Make sure not to cut all the way through when creating the pocket
- Always stuff the chicken before seasoning the outside
- Let the chicken rest after cooking to allow juices to settle and filling to set
- The resting period prevents the filling from oozing out when removing toothpicks
- Freezing chicken briefly before cutting helps create cleaner cuts
