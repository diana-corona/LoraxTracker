## Ingredients
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 ripe avocados
- 4 egg yolks
- ½ cup avocado oil
- Juice of one lemon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1½ teaspoons dry mustard

## Instructions
1. Separate the egg yolks from the whites, reserving yolks
2. Peel and pit the avocados
3. In a food processor, combine crushed garlic, avocado, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, and dry mustard
4. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed
5. With the food processor running, very slowly drizzle in the avocado oil in a thin, steady stream to create an emulsion
6. Add lemon juice and salt
7. Pulse to combine
8. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed
9. Cover tightly with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface (to prevent browning) and refrigerate until ready to use

## Notes
- Keep refrigerated and use within 3 days
- The plastic wrap directly on the surface helps prevent oxidation/browning
- Can be used as a spread, dip, or sauce for:
  - Vegetables
  - Fish
  - Sandwiches
  - Burgers
  - Wraps
- For food safety, use fresh, clean eggs and be aware that this recipe contains raw egg yolks
- The original recipe called for 3 cups of avocado oil, but this has been adjusted to create a more balanced aioli using whole avocados instead
