## Ingredients
- ½ cup almonds
- ½ cup cashews
- 1½ cups Medjool dates, pitted
- Zest and juice from 3 key limes
- ½ cup unsweetened coconut

## Instructions
1. Add almonds and cashews to the bowl of a food processor
2. Pulse until nuts are finely chopped (but not so long that they turn into a paste)
3. Add the pitted dates, lime juice, and lime zest
4. Pulse until the dates are finely chopped and the mixture starts to clump together
5. Shape the mixture into 1½-inch balls
6. Roll each ball in unsweetened coconut to coat the outside
7. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator

## Notes
- Medjool dates are preferred as they're softer and more caramel-like than other varieties
- If dates are very dry, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes, then drain well before using
- Make sure to remove all date pits before processing
- These energy bites can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks
- Can be frozen for up to 3 months
- A small cookie scoop can help create uniformly-sized balls
- For extra lime flavor, you can add a drop of lime essential oil (food grade)
