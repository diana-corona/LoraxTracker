## Notes
- Skin-on salmon is preferred as it helps keep the fish moist
- No need to flip the salmon during cooking
- Can test doneness by checking if fish flakes easily with a fork
- Air fryer temperatures may vary, adjust cooking time accordingly
- For best results, use similar-sized salmon filets
- Can substitute Dijon mustard with whole grain mustard
- Great served with roasted vegetables or rice
