## Ingredients
### Salad
- 12 oz Brussels sprouts, trimmed & shredded (food processor or thinly sliced)
- 1 shallot, minced
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional; use GF or omit for gluten-free)
- 2 tbsp olive oil (divided: 1 1/2 tbsp roast, 1/2 tbsp finish)
- 3/4 cup crushed nuts (walnuts or almonds; seeds for nut-free)
- 1/2 cup pickled red onions
- 1/4 cup vegan parmesan, shredded (optional)
- Salt & freshly cracked black pepper to taste

### Maple Mustard Vinaigrette
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp maple syrup
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 3/4 tsp salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Prep: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone liner.
2. Shred Sprouts: Pulse trimmed Brussels sprouts in food processor until finely shredded (or slice by hand).
3. Roast: Toss shredded sprouts with minced shallot, breadcrumbs (if using), 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread evenly; roast 20–25 minutes, stirring once, until edges are golden.
4. Dressing: While roasting, whisk Dijon, garlic, maple syrup, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper until emulsified.
5. Nuts: Lightly crush nuts (mortar/pestle or sealed bag + rolling pin).
6. Assemble: Transfer roasted sprouts mixture to a bowl. Add crushed nuts, pickled red onions, vegan parmesan (if using), and about 2/3 of the dressing. Toss gently.
7. Finish: Add remaining dressing as desired, adjust salt/pepper/lemon. Drizzle remaining 1/2 tbsp olive oil for sheen (optional). Serve warm.

## Notes
- Gluten-Free: Omit or use GF breadcrumbs.
- Nut-Free: Replace nuts with pumpkin or sunflower seeds.
- Make Ahead: Keep dressing separate; rewarm sprouts at 325°F (160°C) 5–7 min then toss.
- Pickled Onions: Quick-pickle by soaking thin red onion slices in equal parts vinegar & water + pinch salt & sweetener 30 min.
- Texture: For extra crunch add toasted panko (separately) just before serving.
