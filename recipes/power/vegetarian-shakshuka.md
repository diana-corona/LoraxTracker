## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- ½ onion, chopped
- ¼ red bell pepper, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon paprika powder
- ¼ teaspoon cumin powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried chili flakes
- 1 tin (14 oz) chopped tomatoes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg

### Optional Garnishes
- Fresh parsley or cilantro
- Crumbled feta cheese
- Sliced avocado
- Hot sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)
2. Heat coconut oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat
3. Add chopped onion and bell pepper, sauté until softened (about 5 minutes)
4. Add minced garlic, paprika, cumin, and chili flakes; cook for 1 minute until fragrant
5. Pour in the tinned tomatoes, season with salt and pepper
6. Simmer the sauce for 8-10 minutes until slightly thickened
7. Make 3 wells in the sauce using the back of a spoon
8. Carefully crack the whole egg into one well and pour an egg white into each of the other two wells
9. Transfer skillet to preheated oven
10. Bake for 10-15 minutes, checking often to prevent overcooking
11. Eggs are done when whites are set but yolk is still runny (or to your preferred doneness)
12. Remove from oven and let rest for 2-3 minutes
13. Garnish as desired and serve hot

## Notes
- Serve with crusty bread, pita, or low-carb alternatives
- Watch eggs carefully in the oven as they can go from perfect to overcooked quickly
- Can be made spicier by adding more chili flakes or a diced jalapeño
- Make it more substantial by adding:
  - Spinach or kale
  - Mushrooms
  - Chickpeas
  - Zucchini
- The sauce can be made ahead and reheated before adding eggs
- For a dairy-free version, skip the feta garnish
- Using egg whites makes this a lighter version; can use all whole eggs if preferred
