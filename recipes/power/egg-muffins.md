## Ingredients
- 10 large eggs
- ⅓ cup half and half (79mL)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup baby spinach, chopped (20g)
- ½ cup diced red bell pepper (74g)
- ¼ cup diced onion (37g)
- 4 oz feta, crumbled (112g)

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan with butter or baking spray.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, salt, and black pepper.
3. Stir in the spinach, bell pepper, onion, and half of the cheese.
4. Divide the mixture evenly among the muffin cups.
5. Sprinkle tops with the remaining cheese.
6. Bake for 25 minutes or until the eggs are set.
7. Serve immediately or let cool completely and refrigerate in an air-tight container.

## Notes
- Can be stored in an air-tight container for up to 5 days
- Block feta melts better than pre-crumbled feta
- Can substitute feta with cheddar cheese, smoked gouda, or crumbled goat cheese
- Can add ½ cup of cooked meat (sausage, diced ham, or crumbled bacon) - if adding meat, decrease eggs to 8
- Be sure to coat the muffin tin very well with butter, baking spray, or olive oil to prevent sticking
