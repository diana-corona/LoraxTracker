## Ingredients
- 8 large eggs
- ⅓ cup heavy cream (80mL)
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 cups chopped or sliced vegetables (such as bell pepper, potatoes, zucchini)
- 2 cups leafy greens (such as kale or spinach)
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1½ cups shredded or crumbled cheese, plus more for sprinkling (6 ounces)
- Fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F
2. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, and ½ teaspoon salt
3. In a 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat
4. Add the onion and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, frequently stirring until onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes
5. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute
6. Stir in the chopped vegetables. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 to 8 minutes depending on your vegetables
7. Stir in the leafy greens and black pepper. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until wilted
8. Cook until just until the edge starts to set, about 5 minutes
9. Transfer to the oven
10. Bake for 8 minutes or until slightly puffed and the center is set
11. Sprinkle with extra cheese and garnish with pepper and herbs if desired
12. Cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving

## Notes
- If you don't have an oven-safe skillet, transfer sautéed vegetables to a greased casserole dish before adding cheese and egg mixture
- Can use a 10-inch skillet for a thicker frittata (will need extra cooking time)
- Always pre-cook vegetables to avoid a soggy frittata
- Optional vegetables to try:
  - Mushrooms
  - Asparagus
  - Sun-dried tomatoes
  - Peas
  - Leeks
  - Green onions
  - Broccoli
  - Cauliflower
- Optional protein additions:
  - Bacon
  - Ham
  - Sausage
