## Ingredients
- 1 sweet potato, washed and cut into ½-inch wide strips
- 6-8 carrots, washed and cut into ½-inch wide strips
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- 2 tablespoons dried herbs (parsley, rosemary, or thyme)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)
2. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper
3. Cut sweet potato and carrots into uniform ½-inch wide strips
4. In a large bowl, toss the cut vegetables with avocado oil until well coated
5. Add dried herbs, salt, and pepper; toss to distribute evenly
6. Spread vegetables on the prepared baking sheets in a single layer, ensuring pieces don't touch
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes
8. Flip the fries halfway through cooking
9. Continue baking until golden brown and crispy on the outside
10. Serve immediately while hot

## Notes
- Cut vegetables into uniform sizes to ensure even cooking
- Don't overcrowd the baking sheets - use two if necessary
- Soaking the cut vegetables in cold water for 30 minutes before baking can help them become crispier (be sure to dry thoroughly)
- Best served immediately as they will soften as they cool
- Can be reheated in a hot oven for 5 minutes to re-crisp
- Try different herb combinations:
  - Italian: basil, oregano, thyme
  - Provence: herbes de Provence blend
  - Spicy: add cayenne or chili powder
- Can be served with dipping sauces like:
  - Garlic aioli
  - Greek yogurt dip
  - Spicy ketchup
