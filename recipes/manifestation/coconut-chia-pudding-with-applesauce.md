## Ingredients

### Chia Pudding
- 40g chia seeds
- 200ml coconut milk (drinking variety, not canned)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Apple Sauce
- 3 green apples, peeled and chopped
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ cup water
- Pinch of salt

### Optional Toppings
- Fresh berries
- Extra cinnamon
- Coconut flakes
- Chopped nuts

## Instructions

### Apple Sauce
1. Peel, core, and chop the apples into small pieces
2. Place apples in a medium saucepan with water, cinnamon, and salt
3. Bring to a simmer over medium heat
4. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally
5. Once apples are very soft, remove from heat
6. Mash with a potato masher or blend with an immersion blender for smoother consistency
7. Let cool completely

### Chia Pudding
1. In a bowl, whisk together chia seeds, coconut milk, and vanilla
2. Let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk again to prevent clumping
3. Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours or overnight
4. Stir before using

### Assembly
1. Layer chia pudding in a jar or bowl
2. Top with cooled apple sauce
3. Add optional toppings like berries, extra cinnamon, coconut flakes, or nuts

## Notes
- The pudding will thicken as it sits; if too thick, thin with additional coconut milk
- Chia seeds should expand and become gel-like when ready
- Apple sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week
- Can be made ahead for meal prep:
  - Store chia pudding and apple sauce separately
  - Assemble just before serving
- For sweeter apple sauce, use sweeter apple varieties or add a touch of honey
- The consistency of the chia pudding should be thick but spoonable
- Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days
