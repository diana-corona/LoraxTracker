## Ingredients
- 12 ears fresh organic corn
- 1½ red bell peppers, diced
- 1½ green bell peppers, diced
- 1 medium red onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 5 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- Zest of 3 limes
- 1½ teaspoons honey
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- ¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¾ cup finely diced parsley or basil
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

## Instructions
1. Cut corn kernels off the cobs. You can either use them raw for a crunchier salad, or briefly cook them by:
   - Boiling the corn for 3-4 minutes until tender-crisp, then cooling
   - OR grilling the corn for added smoky flavor, then cutting off kernels
2. In a large bowl, combine corn kernels, diced red and green bell peppers, and diced red onion
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dressing:
   - Apple cider vinegar
   - Fresh lime juice
   - Lime zest
   - Honey
   - Olive oil
   - Sea salt
   - Black pepper
   - Cayenne pepper
4. Pour the dressing over the corn mixture and toss to combine
5. Add the finely diced herbs (parsley or basil) and toss gently
6. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed
7. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld
8. Serve chilled or at room temperature

## Notes
- For a spicier kick, add more cayenne pepper
- Can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days
- For easier prep, you can use frozen corn kernels (about 6-7 cups), thawed
- Choose between parsley or basil based on preference - parsley for a fresher taste, basil for a more aromatic flavor
