## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup water (60 mL)
- 1/2 cup vinegar (120 mL) (white or apple cider)
- 1/3 cup sugar (78 mL) (reduce to 1/4 cup for less sweetness)
- 1 1/4 tsp salt (divided: 1 tsp for cucumbers, 1/4 tsp for dressing)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 large English cucumbers (striped peeled, thinly sliced)
- 1 small red onion (halved and thinly sliced)
- 1/4 cup fresh dill (chopped)
- 3 tbsp fresh mint (chopped)

## Instructions
1. In a medium pot combine water, vinegar, and sugar. Heat over medium-high and stir until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat; cool slightly.
2. Thinly slice red onion and add to the warm vinegar mixture. Set aside to quick-pickle while prepping cucumbers.
3. Peel strips from cucumbers for a striped effect (optional) and thinly slice.
4. Place sliced cucumbers in a large bowl, sprinkle with about 1 tsp salt, toss, cover, and chill 30–40 minutes to draw out excess moisture.
5. Drain off released cucumber liquid (do not rinse).
6. Chop dill and mint.
7. Pour the pickled onion and dressing over cucumbers. Add pepper, remaining salt if needed, dill, and mint. Toss to combine.
8. Adjust seasoning (salt/sugar/vinegar) to taste. Serve immediately or chill 15 minutes to meld flavors.

## Notes
- Sweating cucumbers improves texture and prevents a watery salad.
- English cucumbers preferred for fewer seeds; regular cucumbers can be used (peel waxy skin).
- Herbs are flexible: try parsley or tarragon.
- For lighter dressing reduce sugar and/or substitute part with honey.
- Keeps 1–2 days refrigerated; herbs lose brightness over time.
