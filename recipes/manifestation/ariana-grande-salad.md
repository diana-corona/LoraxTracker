## Ingredients
- 2 cups baby spinach (loosely packed)
- 1/2 cup shelled edamame (cooked & cooled)
- 1 cup strawberries, halved (or sliced if large)
- 1 Medjool date, pitted & finely chopped
- 1/2 cup baked extra-firm tofu, chopped (plain or lightly seasoned)
- Pinch flaky salt (optional)

### Citrus Balsamic Dressing
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- (Optional) 1 tsp maple syrup (for extra balance if lemons very tart)
- (Optional) 1–2 tsp olive oil or neutral oil for richer mouthfeel
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Prep Components: Halve strawberries, chop date (small pieces to distribute sweetness), cube baked tofu.
2. Dressing: In a small jar whisk lemon juice, balsamic, (optional) maple syrup and oil, pepper, and a pinch of salt until combined.
3. Assemble: In a bowl add spinach, edamame, strawberries, chopped date, and tofu.
4. Dress & Toss: Pour dressing over just before serving; toss gently to coat.
5. Adjust seasoning (salt, pepper, sweetness) and serve immediately.

## Notes
- Protein Boost: Increase tofu to 3/4 cup or add hemp seeds.
- Edamame: If frozen, boil 3–4 minutes, drain, cool.
- Sweetness: Extra date or maple syrup if a sweeter profile desired.
- Meal Prep: Keep dressing separate; assemble up to 1 day ahead (add strawberries and dressing just before eating).
- Variations: Add avocado slices, mixed greens, or swap strawberries for raspberries/blueberries.
