## Ingredients
- 4 ears corn, husks removed (grilled or pan-roasted; kernels cut off)
- 1 head butter or romaine lettuce, finely chopped
- 1 avocado, cubed
- 1/4 cup chives, chopped
- 1/2 cup pickled red onions
- Salt & pepper to taste

### Cilantro Lime Dressing
- 1 1/2 cups cilantro (loosely packed)
- 1/2 cup plant-based yogurt
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp water (plus more for thinning if needed)

## Instructions
1. Grill (preferred) or pan-roast corn over medium‑high heat 8–10 minutes, turning, until lightly charred. Cool slightly; cut kernels from cobs.
2. Prepare produce: finely chop lettuce, cube avocado, chop chives, and have pickled onions ready.
3. Dressing: Blend cilantro, yogurt, lime juice, garlic, maple syrup, salt, and water until smooth. Thin with extra water to a pourable consistency; adjust lime/salt to taste.
4. In a large bowl combine lettuce, corn kernels, avocado, chives, and pickled onions.
5. Add dressing just before serving; toss gently to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper as needed.
6. Serve immediately (best fresh). For meal prep, store components separately and dress right before eating.

## Notes
- No grill: Sauté corn in a dry or lightly oiled skillet until char spots form.
- Greens swap: spinach, kale (finely chopped/massaged), or arugula.
- Add protein: crispy tofu, beans, or grilled tempeh.
- Use as taco/wrap filling or over baked sweet potato.
- Store (undressed) components up to 3 days; dressed salad best same day.
