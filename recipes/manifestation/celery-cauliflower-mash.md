- 16 ounces grass-fed chèvre (goat cheese)
- ½ cup grass-fed butter, softened
- 2 heads garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for roasting garlic)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Almond milk (optional, for consistency)

## Instructions

### Roasted Garlic
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
2. Chop tip off garlic heads to expose cloves and remove loose peel
3. Drizzle each head with ½ tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with fresh pepper
4. Wrap in foil and bake for 45 minutes
5. Once done, squeeze garlic heads to release cloves and mash them

### Vegetables
1. In a large stockpot with a steamer insert, bring 2 inches of water to boil
2. Reduce heat to simmer
3. Place cauliflower halves and celery root pieces in the steamer
4. Steam for 45 minutes or until tender throughout

### Final Assembly
1. While still warm, cut steamed vegetables into smaller pieces
2. Place pieces in a food processor or high-powered blender
3. Pulse until broken into small pieces
4. Add chèvre and softened butter
5. Add mashed roasted garlic to taste
6. If needed, add small amounts of almond milk to reach desired consistency
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste
8. Blend until smooth and creamy

## Notes
- The less liquid added, the firmer the mash will be
- Sheep's milk cheese can be substituted for the chèvre if available
- For a lighter version, use less cheese and butter
- Can be made ahead and reheated
- Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days
- To reheat, warm gently on stovetop or microwave, adding a splash of milk if needed
- For extra flavor, try adding:
  - Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary)
  - Grated Parmesan
  - Cracked black pepper
  - Chives for garnish
