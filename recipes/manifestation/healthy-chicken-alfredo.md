## Notes
- Using cauliflower creates a creamy sauce with fewer calories
- Make sure to cook cauliflower until very tender for the smoothest sauce
- Can adjust sauce consistency with additional milk if needed
- Can substitute tagliatelle with fettuccine or other long pasta
- For extra flavor, can add Italian herbs to the chicken seasoning
