## Ingredients
- 3 lbs potatoes (Yukon gold, russet, or red-skin), cut into 3/4–1 inch pieces
- 3 tsp salt (divided)
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (divided)
- 1/2 cup red onion, finely diced (75 g)
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise (104 g)
- 1/2 cup sour cream (120 g)
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (plus more to taste)
- 1/2 cup chopped dill pickles (70 g) (dill, spicy, or sweet)
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
- 2 stalks celery, diced (150 g)
- 1/4 cup fresh chopped herbs (dill, parsley, or chives)
- Pinch paprika (garnish)

## Instructions
1. Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch, add 2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a gentle boil, cook until just fork-tender (10–12 min). Drain well.
2. Immediately drizzle hot potatoes with half (2 tbsp) of the vinegar; toss gently and let steam off and cool 10–15 minutes (spread on a tray for faster cooling).
3. While potatoes cool, in a large bowl whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, remaining vinegar, Dijon, remaining 1 tsp salt (adjust later), and black pepper until smooth.
4. Fold in red onion, celery, chopped pickles, eggs, and herbs.
5. Add cooled potatoes and gently fold to coat without breaking them up.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning (salt, pepper, extra vinegar, or a spoon of pickle juice) as desired.
7. Sprinkle with paprika and a little extra chopped herbs. Chill 30 minutes (optional) for flavors to meld or serve at room temperature.

## Notes
- Vinegar soak on hot potatoes boosts flavor absorption.
- Substitute lemon juice or white wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar.
- Sweet pickle relish can replace chopped pickles.
- For lighter version: replace part of mayonnaise with plain yogurt.
- Keep refrigerated up to 3 days; stir in a splash of vinegar if flavor dulls.
