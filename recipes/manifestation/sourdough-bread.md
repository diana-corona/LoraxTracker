### Wild Yeast Starter (Takes 7 days)
1. In a bowl, mix 3 tablespoons of flour with 3 tablespoons of water. Let rest for 24 hours
2. The next day, feed with 2 tablespoons each of flour and water. Let rest another 24 hours
3. Continue feeding with equal amounts of flour and water every 24 hours at the same time
4. After a week, test if it's ready: it should double in volume within 3 hours of feeding

### Sourdough Starter
1. In a bowl, mix flour, water, and wild yeast starter
2. Let rest for 6 hours at room temperature

### Final Bread
1. In a large bowl, combine flour, water, salt, and the mature sourdough starter. Mix for one minute and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature
2. Perform the first fold: stretch and fold each of the four sides of the dough onto itself. Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 35 minutes
3. With wet hands, perform the second fold in the same way. Rest 30 minutes
4. Perform the third fold. Rest 30 minutes
5. Perform the fourth and final fold. Rest 30 minutes
6. Shape the dough by folding and compacting it, dusting with flour between folds
7. Place in a banneton (sourdough proofing basket) and refrigerate covered with plastic wrap for at least 12 hours
8. Preheat a cast iron Dutch oven in a 250째C (482째F) oven for 30-40 minutes
9. Remove the proofed bread from the basket using parchment paper
10. Score the bread lengthwise, place in the hot Dutch oven, and cover
11. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then remove the lid and reduce temperature to 200째C (392째F)
12. Bake for an additional 20 minutes uncovered
13. Remove from the oven and Dutch oven
14. Let cool for at least 1 hour before slicing

## Notes
- The wild yeast starter process takes about a week before it's ready to use
- Temperature and humidity can affect fermentation times
- A Dutch oven or cast iron pot with lid is essential for proper crust development
- The long refrigeration helps develop flavor and makes the dough easier to handle
