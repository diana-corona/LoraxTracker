### Salad
- 8 cups organic green lettuce, sliced (about 1 head)
- 8 large organic strawberries

- 1 tablespoon avocado oil (for toasting almonds)

### Dressing

- 2 tablespoons local raw honey
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice (preferably Meyer lemon)

## Instructions

### Toasted Almonds
1. Heat avocado oil in a small skillet over medium heat
2. Add sliced almonds and toast, stirring frequently, until golden brown (about 3-4 minutes)
3. Remove from heat and let cool

### Dressing
1. In a mason jar, combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, and lemon juice
2. Shake well until thoroughly combined

### Assembly
1. Rinse lettuce and dry thoroughly in a salad spinner or with paper towels

3. Slice strawberries into thin slivers
4. Add sliced strawberries, chopped cilantro, and feta cheese to the lettuce
5. Top with toasted almonds
6. Just before serving, drizzle with dressing and toss gently

## Notes
- Adjust feta cheese amount to taste (3-5 tablespoons)
- Can substitute other nuts for almonds (pecans or walnuts work well)
- For a dairy-free version, omit feta or substitute with dairy-free cheese
- Store dressing separately if making ahead
- Best served immediately after dressing
- To make ahead:
