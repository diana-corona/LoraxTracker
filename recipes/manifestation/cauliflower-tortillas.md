7. Place ¼ cup portions of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets
8. Using the back of a spoon or spatula, spread each portion into a thin circle (about 6 inches in diameter)

- The tortillas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days
- Can be frozen with parchment paper between layers for up to 3 months
- These are more delicate than regular tortillas, handle with care
- Use them for tacos, wraps, or as a bread substitute
- For extra flavor, you can add:
  - Garlic powder
  - Dried herbs
  - Ground cumin
  - Nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor
- If you don't have a microwave, you can steam the riced cauliflower instead
