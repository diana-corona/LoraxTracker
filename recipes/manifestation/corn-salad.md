## Ingredients
- 6 ears fresh corn, shucked (about 5 cups kernels / 750 g) OR grilled corn
- 6 tbsp cider vinegar (90 mL) (sub: white or red wine vinegar, or lime juice)
- 3/4 tsp salt (plus extra to taste)
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 6 tbsp olive oil (90 mL)
- 1 cup diced cucumber (140 g)
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved (200 g)
- 1/2 cup diced red onion (30 g)
- 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled (70 g)
- 1/3 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped (8 g)
- (Optional) 1 jalapeño, seeded & finely diced
- (Optional garnish) Extra basil or feta

## Instructions
1. Cook Corn: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil corn 3–4 minutes until crisp-tender (do not overcook). Transfer to a tray to cool. (Alternatively grill corn until lightly charred on all sides, cool.)
2. Dressing: In a large mixing bowl whisk vinegar, salt, and pepper. While whisking slowly stream in olive oil to emulsify.
3. Prep Vegetables: Dice cucumber, halve tomatoes, dice red onion, chop basil, (and jalapeño if using).
4. Cut Kernels: Once cool enough to handle, stand each ear vertically on a cutting board and slice kernels off.
5. Combine: Add corn kernels, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, feta, basil (and jalapeño) to the bowl. Toss gently to coat in dressing.
6. Adjust: Taste; add more salt, pepper, vinegar/lime juice, or a drizzle more olive oil as desired.
7. Serve immediately at room temperature or chill 15–30 minutes for flavors to meld. Garnish with extra basil or feta.

## Notes
- Grilled corn adds smokiness; boil for quickest prep.
- Dice ingredients uniformly so each bite has all components.
- Do not overcook corn or sweetness and texture suffer.
- Add jalapeño for heat or omit for milder salad.
- Substitutions: vinegar → lime juice; basil → cilantro or parsley; feta → queso fresco or goat cheese.
- Make Ahead: Dress up to 2 hours before serving; stir and refresh with a splash of vinegar before serving.
- Storage: Refrigerate airtight up to 2 days (basil will darken slightly).
